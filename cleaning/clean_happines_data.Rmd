```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```
### Load Librarys

-- Load Library for reading CSV Files.

```{r eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
library(csvread)
```

### Read raw data

-- Read CSV File "world_happiness_report_2015.csv"  

```{r eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
happiness_raw <- read.csv(file = "../data/raw_data/world_happiness_report_2015.csv", header = TRUE)
happiness_raw
```

## Clean Data

-- Delete Column, as it will be incorrect, when later deleting countries

```{r eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
happiness_raw[3] <- NULL
```

-- Renaming columns

```{r eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
names(happiness_raw)[3]<- "Happiness.Score"
names(happiness_raw)[4]<- "Happiness.Score.Standard.Error"
names(happiness_raw)[5]<- "Economy.GDP.per.Capita"
names(happiness_raw)[6]<- "Family"
names(happiness_raw)[7]<- "Health.Life.Expectancy"
names(happiness_raw)[8]<- "Freedom"
names(happiness_raw)[9]<- "Trust.Government.Corruption"
names(happiness_raw)[10]<- "Generosity"
names(happiness_raw)[11]<- "Dystopia.Residual"
```

-- rename Countries  

```{r eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE}

ind <- which(levels(happiness_raw$Country)=="Republic of Korea", arr.in=TRUE)
levels(happiness_raw$Country)[ind] <- "North Korea"

ind <- which(levels(happiness_raw$Country)=="Russia", arr.in=TRUE)
levels(happiness_raw$Country)[ind] <- "Russian Federation"

happiness_clean <- happiness_raw
happiness_clean
```

-- Write into CSV

```{r eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
write.csv(happiness_clean, file = "../data/clean_data/happiness_data.csv",row.names=FALSE, na="", col.names = TRUE)

```
